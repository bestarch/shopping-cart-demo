# Price/discount calculation 

This demonstrates how can price or discount can be calculated in a typical e-com application based on different business criteria or rules.

This project uses Drools Business Rules Engine for processing and calculating applicable discounts for any purchase amount.
The rules are supplied as .drl files which are present inside the resources/rules directory.
